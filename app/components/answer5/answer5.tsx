        <p>Question 5: A building has 100 floors. One of the floors is the highest floor an egg can be dropped <br />
          from without breaking. If an egg is dropped from above that floor, it will break. If it is <br />
          dropped from that floor or below, it will be completely undamaged and you can drop the <br />
          egg again. Given two eggs, find the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without <br />
          breaking, with as few drops as possible in the worst-case scenario.
        </p>
